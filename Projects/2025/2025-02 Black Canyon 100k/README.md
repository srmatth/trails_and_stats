# Black Canyon 100k 2025

In this project I created four infographics that visualize some key aspects of the 2025 Black Canyon 100k.
This one isn't really any hard data science or statistics, it was more or an artistic endeavor. Feedback appreciated!

## Folders and Files

- `R Code` contains the R code used to manipulate and plot the data for my second, third, and fourth visualizations. Each one has its own file.
- `Python Code` contains a couple `.ipynb` files where I scraped the historical Black Canyon data (from [ultrasignup](https://ultrasignup.com/results_event.aspx?did=115592)) and the split data (from [Aravaipa Live](https://live.aravaiparunning.com/#/black_canyon-2025)). Note that I moved these notebooks into this folder after using them, so some of the relative paths are probably messed up.
- `SVG Files` contains `.svg` files of my work for this project
- `test_img` contains mid-process or throw-away test images
- `data` contains the historical race results (but not the split data, that is in the main directory)
- The final visualizations are also in the main directory

## Other Notes

- Images used were taken from Social Media (Strava, Instagram, Facebook)
- Sometimes the split data is unreliable. Frequently runners miss being tracked at a mat. The first and third visualization placings were created via a mix of the file and also watching the race on the livestream.
- I do indeed believe the depth is deep
