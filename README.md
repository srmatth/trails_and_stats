# Trails and Stats

Code, (some) data, analyses, and visualizations for the [trails_and_stats instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/trails_and_stats/).


## Structure of the Repository

Feel free to navigate around as you will. The main folders that you will be interested are listed below with a brief description:

### `General Code`

Code that is sometimes shared across projects, such as webscrapers or helper functions.

### `General Data`

Data that may be pertinent to more than one project, such as race results, gear data, etc.

### `Projects`

Organized by year, each directory contains one project. Every project directory has its own `README` file.
